    "# MENACE Game: Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This code implements a simplified version of the MENACE (Machine Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine) model for playing Tic-Tac-Toe. MENACE uses an epsilon-greedy algorithm to choose actions, updates its model based on the result of each game, and saves and loads the model state using Python's `pickle` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MENACE Class\n",
    "\n",
    "### `__init__(self, model_file=\"menace_model.pkl\")`\n",
    "The constructor method initializes the MENACE object and attempts to load an existing model from a file. If the model does not exist, it starts with a fresh model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`self.states`**: A `defaultdict` of `defaultdict(int)` to store state-action pairs and their corresponding weights. Each state-action pair represents the possible moves MENACE can make in the game.\n",
    "- **`self.epsilon`**: A parameter used for the epsilon-greedy algorithm, where the action is chosen randomly with a probability of `epsilon`, promoting exploration.\n",
    "- **`self.model_file`**: The file name where the model (state-action weights) is saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `choose_action(self, state)`\n",
    "This method selects an action based on the epsilon-greedy strategy. The action is chosen from valid moves in the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a random value is less than `epsilon`, MENACE explores by selecting a random valid action.\n",
    "- Otherwise, MENACE exploits its learned strategy by selecting the action with the highest weight in the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `update_weights(self, history, result)`\n",
    "This method updates the state-action weights based on the result of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`history`**: A list of tuples containing the states and actions MENACE took during the game.\n",
    "- **`result`**: A string representing the game outcome (`\"win\"`, `\"loss\"`, or `\"draw\"`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "If MENACE wins, the state-action weights are increased for the moves that led to the win. If MENACE loses, the weights are decreased for the moves that led to the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `get_valid_actions(state)`\n",
    "This static method returns a list of valid actions (empty cells) from the current game state. It identifies cells in the Tic-Tac-Toe grid where there is no move (i.e., where the cell value is `0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### `check_winner(state)`\n",
    "This static method checks the winner of the game by evaluating all possible winning combinations in the Tic-Tac-Toe grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a winning combination exists with all `X` (MENACE's moves), it returns `\"MENACE\"`.\n",
    "- If a winning combination exists with all `O` (User's moves), it returns `\"User\"`.\n",
    "- If no winner is found, it returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `print_board(state)`\n",
    "This static method prints the Tic-Tac-Toe board based on the current state. It converts the internal state (which is a list of integers) to human-readable symbols:\n",
    "- `1` -> `\"X\"` (MENACE's move)\n",
    "- `-1` -> `\"O\"` (User's move)\n",
    "- `0` -> `\" \"` (empty cell)\n",
    "\n",
    "### `play_game(self)`\n",
    "This method runs the main game loop where MENACE plays against the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MENACE's Turn**: MENACE selects an action using `choose_action` and updates the state by placing its symbol (`\"X\"`) in the selected cell. The game board is printed.\n",
    "2. **Check for Winner**: After MENACE plays, the game checks if MENACE or the user has won or if the game is a draw.\n",
    "3. **User's Turn**: The user is prompted to enter a valid move (a number between 0 and 8). The game ensures that the move is valid (i.e., an empty cell).\n",
    "4. **Check for Winner**: After the user plays, the game checks if the user has won.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game continues until there is a winner or a draw. After each game, the model is updated, and the model's state is saved to disk using `save_model()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `save_model(self)`\n",
    "This method saves the current state-action weights of MENACE to a file using `pickle`. The model is stored as a serialized object, allowing it to be loaded again in future sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `load_model(self)`\n",
    "This method loads the saved model from a file. If the file does not exist (i.e., this is the first time running the game), it starts with an empty model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`pickle.load(f)`**: Reads the model from the file and loads it into `self.states`.\n",
    "- If the file is not found, it prints a message and initializes the model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
